The program features former United States Army Ranger, United States Air Force Pararescueman and star of Military's hit series Special Ops Mission Wil Willis.

In each episode, Willis tests a series of iconic firearms, from muskets and pistols to assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, and examines their historical significance. The premiere episode looks at the evolution of the handgun, going back to its earliest days on 16th century battlefields.

Mike Tristano provided most of the weapons featured on the show. He is a fully licensed Master Armorer with over 25 years of experience and more than 400 film and television credits.

The series was broadcast weekly in the UK on the Freeview channel Quest starting on Thursday 17 May 2012. The initial word of the title was dropped, giving the shorter form Weapons that Changed the World.",World Trigger
